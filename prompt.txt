I’d like you to provide the entire project code in a single valid JSON object. 

Each top-level key represents either:
- A folder (which is itself a JSON object), or
- A file (with its content as a string).

Important details:

1. Do NOT use any duplicate folder names at the same level. For example, if you have a `backend` folder, it appears only once. 
2. Each folder (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`) may contain multiple files like "Dockerfile", "main.py", etc. The file's entire code must be in the string value of that key.
3. Top-level files (like "cloudbuild.yaml", "README.md", "setup.py") should appear directly in the JSON, not inside a subfolder.
4. Return only valid JSON — no Markdown code fences or extra explanations.
5. Escape any special characters so the JSON can be parsed by `json.loads(...)` without errors.
6. No duplicate keys. If a folder is named "frontend", it should only appear once.

An example structure (shortened) might be:
{
  "backend": {
    "Dockerfile": "...",
    "main.py": "...",
    "requirements.txt": "..."
  },
  "frontend": {
    "Dockerfile": "...",
    "app.py": "...",
    "requirements.txt": "..."
  },
  "cloudbuild.yaml": "...",
  "README.md": "...",
  "setup.py": "..."
}

Please output only the JSON.
